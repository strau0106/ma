First couple of hours spent doing ALU stuff. It works now... 

Still very unsure how the middle part has to look. 

Just requirements wont be enough. 

Design considerations?

Can I say I just arbitrarily came up with the requirements

and then justify the implementation????

things for after lunch

Unfortunately lunch didnt enlighten me.

I should be able to do so. It's a "produkt arbeit" after all. 

How nice it would be to have my supervisor to discuss these things.
