Jotting down some thoughts on the assembler.

Collect and Find all Macro instructions
try to generate microcode from that.
then assemble.
compute memory MAKRO instr = dataword 1; possible data = dataword 2;
at this point i should probably also test microcode and assembler.

but ill just do that in CPU, i dont want to switch build system. ALTHOUGH I HATE MAKE, not sure if the effort is worth at this point tbh.
