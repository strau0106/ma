\begin{feat-requirement}
  Ability to load a data word for storage.
\end{feat-requirement}

\begin{feat-requirement}
  Ability to output a data word.
\end{feat-requirement}

The registers must also directly interface with the ALU, by providing direct access without any control signals. 

\begin{arch-requirement} \label{req:register-direct-access}
  Must be able to be read by the ALU without any control signals.
