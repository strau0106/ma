\subsection{Control Unit}

The Control Unit:

Responsible for fetch decode execute:  

Fetch: Get Instr

Decode: Makro to Micro instructions

Execute: If MAR get second data word: 
Otherwise go through timing states

if instr jmp trigger jmp. 

Also is clock. 

Also is instruction register and program counter as per von Neumann.



\begin{arch-requirement}
  Must produce the control word (micro instruction) from instruction and clock signal.
\end{arch-requirement}

\begin{arch-requirement}
  Must be reprogrammable for every computer run.
\end{arch-requirement}

\begin{turing-requirement}
  Must produce the control word from flags.
\end{turing-requirement}

\begin{feat-requirement}
  Must, given a specific output of the microcode break out of the current instruction. 
\end{feat-requirement}

\begin{feat-requirement}
  Must halt the clock given micro/macrocode instruction to do so. 
\end{feat-requirement}

\begin{feat-requirement}
  Must to halt given micro/macrocode instruction to do so. 
\end{feat-requirement}

\begin{feat-requirement}
  Must reset given micro/macrocode instruction to do so. 
\end{feat-requirement}

List of requirements not final.
