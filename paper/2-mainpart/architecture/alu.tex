Each OP as individual wire, because decoding instr is not part of the ALUs purpose. (This is normal, vgl. Digital Computer electronics p. 175). Also decreased complexity 9 vs. 4 wires and a bunch of decoding logic?

Direct Register Access because wanting to save timing states and is more easier. 



Given those requirements a list of signals going into and out of the module can be compiled. 

\begin{table}[]
\begin{tabular}{ccc}
Type& Name & Purpose \\ \hline
I   & Clock & Timinga \\
O   & Bus     & Data output         \\
I   & Register 1 and 2 & Data input \\
I   & ALU control word & Control \\
O   & Status flag word & Control
\end{tabular}
\caption{}
\label{tab:alu-i/o}
\end{table}

Given this Netlist

Karnaugh map of Operations.
