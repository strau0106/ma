Last couple of weeks, crazy shit. 

control unit is basically done, just untested feature set right now. 

also reset has to be tested everywhere. 

microcode generation in cpp is working, i played around with different patterns for definition. i like builder pattern, gives a bit more readablity than just 0 and 1. 

pipelines hate me. 

well actually there is just a weird mutex lock from verilog with fst dumps, apparently. i opened a github issue about lets see how it plays out. for now i just split out the pipeline, for coverage and without. 

q's for ros: 
\begin{enumerate}
  \item process deviation, control\_word. ok if i just do like yeah proc dev doesnt exist
  \item 
\end{enumerate}
