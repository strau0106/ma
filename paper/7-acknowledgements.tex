I would like to thank all the people that made this project possible: My supervisors Stefan Rothe and Corinne SÃ¶rensen, for their invaluable guidance and feedback, all the friends that supported me, especially Fabio, Giulio, Lexa and Wilco with their proofreading and motivation and my institution for providing git infrastructure.
