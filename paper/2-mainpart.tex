\chapter{Process change title}


Planning is the first and most important step in a development process.

The first step is the definition of the computer architecture, establishing its requirements and defining the individual components. Then from each module's requirements write

The first step towards the completion of the simulation of this computer architecture is the definition of its precise and testable requirements. After establishing the requirements the next step will be the splitting of the architecture into individual modules. Modules shall be largely self-contained apart from control signals and the bus. Then, for each requirement write a unit test and then Verilog code to pass the tests and thus fulfill the requirements. Finally, connect the modules together and verify the architecture is working as intended. 

Before any digital development of the architecture and its supporting code infrastructure, the development environment and operations must be setup to continously test and build the code to ensure retraceability of the development.
